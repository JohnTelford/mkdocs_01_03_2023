GitHub is a Distributed Version Control Systems enabling multiple teams to work separately on the same project without having an impact on the work of others. GitHub manages an online web hosted central project repository containing all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes. The Central Repository is managed my a team member It helps answer the questions for the lifetime of the project who changed what, where, when, and why? Team members use the Website Development Stack to develop and deploy websites to the Internet. There would be confusion and possible defects created if Team members were to directly make changes to the central project repository. A solution to this problem is to have one central repository controlled by a team member gatekeeper. Each team member forks a copy of central project repository to their GetHub account and makes a clone of it on their workstation. Each developer makes changes to their repository clone . They cannot directly make changes to the central repository. Team members commit changes to their local repository clone They may deploy their local repository to a private Preview Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback. The process is managed using GitHub for Teams . When stakeholders determine developers changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, a GitHub Pull Request is made by developers to the central project repository. Project team members and the gatekeeper are notified by GitHub of the Pull Request request. They may examine, comment on, suggest possible changes, and test the code. When the team agrees on committed developers changes, they are committed to the central project repository by the gatekeeper. This process is repeated for all developer committed changes. Iterations of the central project repository may be deployed by the gatekeeper to a private Preview for stakeholders viewing. The next step is each developer Pulls the central repository changes and commits them to their local repository copy of the central project. This process keeps team members up to date on changes. The central project repository may be deployed to the public Internet by the gatekeeper after stakeholders agree there have been sufficient development and testing iterations.","title":"Iterative Website Development"}]}
