### Troika 

:::info
Troika is a team of three web website programming languages that have become standard for creating web pages, [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).  They are interpreted  by web browsers to rendering website pages.
:::

The job of website development frameworks is to compile the troika and non troika programming languages, such as MDX and JSX, into a combination the standard troika languages to be executed in web browsers.

### Hypertext Markup Language {#html}

![HTML](/img/HTML5logo.png)

[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is used to create websites. It is the standard markup language for browser website pages. It defines the content and structure of website pages. HTML can be assisted by Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)) to instruct browsers how elements are to be styled and rendered, and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is for user interactivity.

### JavaScript 

> Not to be confused with the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html) programming language.

![JavaScript](/img/JavaScript.png)

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) Used to make webpages interactive. It is the programming language of the web. It is the most popular website programming language choice for the million of programmers globally. It is a high-level language, flexible and expressive enough to write website applications. It has many advantages. It is dynamically typed, requires no compile step, and has a huge ecosystem that provides powerful frameworks, libraries, and other tools. JavaScript is one of the core technologies of website [Troika](#troika) website programming. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. All contemporary web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript virtual machine built-inn to execute it.

### CSS 

![CSS](/img/CSS3logo.png)

[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

CSS instructs browsers how elements are to be styled and rendered.

## Web Components

:::info
*Web Development Components For The Component Era.* Web Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) functions, but work in isolation.

:::

Web components are
a set of web platform APIs that enables creating new custom, reusable, encapsulated [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) tags to use in web pages and web apps.

Based on existing web standards. They enable web developers to extend [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.

### React 

![reactLogo](/img/reactLogo.png)

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created by Facebook.

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library. It enables creating complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React code is made of entities called components. Components can be rendered to a particular element. A component is the core building block of a React application. Every component resides in the same space, but works independently from one another and merges all them in a parent component, which is the final UI of the application."

### React JSX {#jsx}

![jsxlogo](/img/jsxlogo.png)

The core development technology of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and React is [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). React has created JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript. JSX is not part of the web programming languages [Troika](programming#troika). Browsers do not understand how to render JSX. React created a compiler to transform JSX code into standard JavaScript at build time.

JSX (JavaScript XML), is a React syntax extension to the JavaScript language. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. It is similar in appearance to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are written using JSX.

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with cohesive components that contain both.

### MDX 

![mdxLogo](/img/mdxLogo.png)

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is Markdown for the component era. It enables seamlessly writing JSX in Markdown documents. It is compiled to JSX components, It enables using Markdown’s terse syntax for writing website material, and JSX for components.

Markdown is a faster way of creating and maintaining website material. It is a HTLM abstraction that is compiled to web standard [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

John Gruber published the original Markdown Syntax Guide. Different flavors of Markdown have evolved since then.

"Markdown is a better way to write HTML. It is compiled into HTML at deploy time. Markdown is a lightweight plaintext markup language used to add formatting elements to documents. Markdown is now one of the world’s popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown is not like that. In a Markdown-formatted file. Markdown syntax is added to the text to indicate which words and phrases look different."

Markdown has been characterized by an informal specification and a reference implementation for conversion to HTML. Over time, many Markdown implementations have appeared. They are driven by the need for additional features like tables, footnotes, definition lists, and HTML inside Markdown blocks. The behavior of additional features diverge from the reference implementation and informal specification, and have attracted attention. Not all flavors of Markdown are compatible or supported by all frameworks.

I'm hesitant creating website material without using a version of Markdown. My preference is using MDX.

❤️ Powerful: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in React/JSX-based projects.
>
💻 Everything is a component: Use existing components inside MDX file and import other MDX files as plain components.
>
🔧 Customizable: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown element.
>
📚 Markdown-based: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains, JSX is interleaved when you want to.
>
🔥 Blazingly blazing fast: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage."

## Other Languages

:::info
Other languages besides the [Troika](#troika) are frequently needed to create and deploy websites
:::

Some are:

### Editor commands

### Website Material

- [Troika](programming#troika)

- [MDX](programming#mdx)

### Command-line interface

Operating system (OS) command-line interfaces are usually distinct programs supplied with the operating system. A program that implements such a text interface is often called a command-line interpreter, command processor or shell. 

### Version Control System

- [git](developmenttools#git) commands

- [GitHub](developmenttools#github) commands

### Static Static Site Generator commands

### Deploy commands
