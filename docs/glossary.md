When the pull request team and stakeholders are satisfied the updated production changes are ready for deployment, the repository guardian deploys the updated production version of the website to a private Internet website for stakeholders to preview and give feedback. When the stakeholders are satisfied with the updated production version, the repository guardian deploys the updated production version of the website to the Internet
