!!! abstract "Purpose"
    The purpose of Iterative Website Development is to minimize website projects life time costs

- Iterative website development is done by different teams with different responsibilities and skills.
 
- The Define, Design, Develop, Deploy and Maintenance team members create, test and [Remediating Defects](defect_remediation_cost.md)â€‹. All team members may be operational at the same time without interfering with each other, or the production website, during the lifetime of the website

<!--
- Each team member iterates their portion of the website by creating, testing and [Remediating Defects](defect_remediation_cost.md)
-->

- Each team member frequently deploys their work to a private [Preview](preview.md) internet website for stakeholders to quickly view and give feedback
