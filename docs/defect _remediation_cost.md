import Danger from "./danger.md";

- The highest cost over the life time of website projects is remediating defects.

- Content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:

##### Defect Remediation Costs

The early defect detection mechanisms built into iterative development and a static site generator are:

- VScode editor tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors

	- Fast refresh live-editing quickly showing changes and any runtime errors while typing

- Team members deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes, to private websites where stakeholders can see them and give feedback. See Preview Deployments

  
!!! Danger "Defects"
	The slightest defects or security issues during the project will require [Remediating](defect _remediation_cost.md) and increase lifetime costs
