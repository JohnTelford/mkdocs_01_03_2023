Alternatives to using built-in [VScode](#vscode) [git]() commands is to use the built in terminal or [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop). It abstract [Github](#github) and more [Git](#git) commands. It interacts with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. 

[GitHub Desktop and VSCode](http://www.rodanthi-alexiou.com/github-101-github-desktop-and-vscode/) documents how to use GitHub Desktop with [VScode](#vscode).
