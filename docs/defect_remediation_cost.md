##### Defect Remediation Costs

The early defect detection mechanisms built into Iterative Development and [MkDocs]() site generator are:

- VScode editor tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors

	- Fast refresh live-editing quickly showing changes and any runtime errors while typing

- Team members deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes, to private websites where stakeholders can see them and give feedback. See Preview Deployments
 
!!! Danger "Defects"
	The slightest configuration, programming or security defect issues during the project will require Remediating and increasing overall lifetime costs
