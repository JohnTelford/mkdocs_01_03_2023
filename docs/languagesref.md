title: Development Languages
---


!!! info

	Website development languages are used to create website material such as text and graphics, and for configuring and using website development tools such as, [VScode](#vscode), [Git](developmenttools/#git), [GitHub](developmenttools/#github), [Docusaurus](#docusaurus), and [Cloudflare](#cloudflare). These languages are nonhuman, abstract logical structures, and strict languages. The slightest errors or security issues during development will require remediation sometime during the life time of the website. Several development languages and tools detect errors. Developer created abstract logical structures, and user interface designs problems, may be mitigated by developers frequent deploying their work to private [Preview](deploy#preview) Internet websites for team members viewing and feedback.

## Website Development Stack

!!! info

	The *Iterative Website Development Stack* illustrates how websites are developed and deployed to the Internet. It is web browser agnostic. What works for big screens, works for small screens. The key technologies are [GitHub](developmenttools#github) and [git](developmenttools#git).

:::

![Developer Iterative Development Stack](/img/websitedev.png){ width=50% height=50% }

Team members use the Website Development Stack to develop and deploy websites to the Internet. 

There would be confusion and defects created if Team members were to directly make changes to the same project repository.  

A solution to this problem is to have one central repository controlled by a gatekeeper. Each team member [forks](glossary#fork) a copy to their GetHub account and makes a clone of it on their workstation.

---

## GitHub

The core of Iterative Development is the [GitHub](developmenttools/#github) central project repository controlled by the project gatekeeper.

GitHub is a Distributed Version Control Systems enabling multiple teams to work separately without having an impact on the work of others. GitHub manages an online web hosted central project repository containing all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes.

> It helps answer the questions for the lifetime of the project *who changed what, where, when, and why?* 

Team members use the [Website Development Stack](#website-development-stack) to develop and deploy websites to the Internet.

### The GitHub Flow

GitHub workflow centered on [Pull Requests](#pull-request). The GitHub flow works with collaborating tightly-knit team in a central project repository, or a globally distributed company or network of strangers contributing to a project through dozens of [Forks](#fork). It is centered on the topic [Branches](#branch) workflow.

A summary of GitHub flow for each **team member** is:

1. [Fork](#fork) the central project repository to create local project repository in GitHub account
2. Clone the forked local project repository in team member GitHub account to a workstation
1. Creates a topic [branch](#branch) off the cloned local project repository main branch
1. Make edits and commits 
2. Push after each commit to the cloned local project repository in GitHub account
3. Deploy local project repository to a private [Preview](deploy#preview) website for stake holders viewing
1. Open a [Pull Request](#pull-request) on the GitHub local project repository to begin the  process of integrating the local project repository with the central project repository  
1. Team members discuss, and optionally continue committing on [Pull Requests](#pull-request).

The project gatekeeper merges or closes the Pull Requests to the central project repository, and deploys the central project repository to a private[Preview](deploy#preview) website for stack holders viewing. The teams and gatekeeper continues the GitHub Flow process until stack holders agree the central project repository is ready for release to the public internet 

Teams may [Pull](#pull) the central project repository at anytime to view and test other topic branches.

## Git

[Git](developmenttools/#git)
## Basic Git Commands

### Branch

Creating a branch is to safely diverge from a line of development and continuing on another. An example is creating a branch to test a radical idea


### Fork

A *fork* is copying the central website project repository to a team member GitHub accounts. Teams make changes to the website project repository publicly as a way to contribute in a more open manner.

A *fork* is a copy of the project repository in a team member's GitHub account. Forks let teams make changes to a project without affecting the original repository or other team members. Teams can fetch updates from the project repository with a [pull](#pull) command from or submit changes using the [Pull Requests](#pull-request)

[About Forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)

### Pull

### Pull Request

Pull requests let teams tell others about changes that have been pushed to a branch in their GitHub account forked project repository. Once a pull request is opened by the project team gatekeeper, teams can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before changes are merged into the website central project repository.

[About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

### Push

## Website Development Languages

### Troika

:::info
Troika is a team of three web website programming languages that have become standard for creating website pages, [HTML](#html), [CSS](#css), and [JavaScript](#javascript).  They are interpreted by web browsers to render website pages.
:::

The job of website development frameworks such as [Docusaurus](#docusaurus) is to compile the troika and non troika programming languages, such as React, JSX, and MDX into the standard troika languages for web browsers.


### HTML

Hypertext Markup Language

![HTML](/img/HTML5logo.png)

[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is used to create websites. It is the standard markup language for browser website pages. It defines the content and structure of website pages. HTML can be assisted by Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS](#css)) to instruct browsers how elements are to be styled and rendered, and [JavaScript](#javascript) is for user interactivity.


### CSS

CSS instructs browsers how elements are to be styled and rendered.

![CSS](/img/CSS3logo.png)

[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in [HTML](#html)


### JavaScript

> Not to be confused with the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html) programming language.

![JavaScript](/img/JavaScript.png)

[JavaScript](#javascript) is used to make webpages interactive. It is the programming language of the web. It is the most popular website programming language choice for the million of programmers globally. It is a high-level language, flexible and expressive enough to write website applications. It has many advantages. It is dynamically typed, requires no compile step, and has a huge ecosystem that provides powerful frameworks, libraries, and other tools. JavaScript is one of the core technologies of website [Troika](#troika) website programming. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. All contemporary web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript virtual machine built-inn to execute it.

## Web Component Era

:::info
*Web Development Components For The Component Era.* Web Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as [JavaScript](#javascript) functions, but work in isolation.

:::

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that enables creating new custom, reusable, encapsulated [HTML](#html) tags to use in web pages and web apps.

Based on existing web standards. They enable web developers to extend [HTML](#html) with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.

---

### React 

![reactLogo](/img/reactLogo.png)

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs). It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](#javascript) library created by Facebook.

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library. It enables creating complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React code is made of entities called components. Components can be rendered to a particular element. A component is the core building block of a React application. Every component resides in the same space, but works independently from one another and merges all them in a parent component, which is the final UI of the application."

---

### JSX
 
![jsxlogo](/img/jsxlogo.png)

The core development technology of [Docusaurus](#docusaurus) and React is [JavaScript](#javascript). React has created JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript. JSX is not part of the web programming languages [Troika](#troika). Browsers do not understand how to render JSX. React created a compiler to transform JSX code into standard JavaScript at build time.

JSX (JavaScript XML), is a React syntax extension to the JavaScript language. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. It is similar in appearance to [HTML](#html), JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are written using JSX.

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with cohesive components that contain both.

---

### MDX 

<!--
![mdxLogo](/img/mdxLogo.png)
-->

<img src="/img/mdxLogo.png" width="100" />

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is Markdown for the component era. It enables seamlessly writing [JSX](#jsx) in Markdown documents. It is compiled to JSX components, It enables using Markdown’s terse syntax for writing website material, and JSX for components.

Markdown is a faster way of creating and maintaining website material. It is a HTLM abstraction that is compiled to web standard [HTML](#html)

John Gruber published the original Markdown Syntax Guide. Different flavors of Markdown have evolved since then.

"Markdown is a better way to write HTML. It is compiled into HTML at deploy time. Markdown is a lightweight plaintext markup language used to add formatting elements to documents. Markdown is now one of the world’s popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown is not like that. In a Markdown-formatted file. Markdown syntax is added to the text to indicate which words and phrases look different."

Markdown has been characterized by an informal specification and a reference implementation for conversion to HTML. Over time, many Markdown implementations have appeared. They are driven by the need for additional features like tables, footnotes, definition lists, and HTML inside Markdown blocks. The behavior of additional features diverge from the reference implementation and informal specification, and have attracted attention. Not all flavors of Markdown are compatible or supported by all frameworks.

I'm hesitant creating website material without using a version of Markdown. My preference is using MDX.

❤️ Powerful: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in React/JSX-based projects.
>
💻 Everything is a component: Use existing components inside MDX file and import other MDX files as plain components.
>
🔧 Customizable: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown element.
>
📚 Markdown-based: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains, JSX is interleaved when you want to.
>
🔥 Blazingly blazing fast: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage."
