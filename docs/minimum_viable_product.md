title: Minimum Viable Product​
---

The first goal of website development projects is a Minimum Viable Product.

- It is a way to understand whether the website project idea will work or not. It is a stage in website development where the must features are implemented and ready to test with end-users. It gives feedback about the positive aspects and shortcomings.

- The next steps are adding the want features, until stakeholders agree the website is production quality and ready to be deployment.
