title: Iterative Website Development

!!! Abstract 

	The Iterative Website Development Stack illustrates how websites are developed by teams and deployed to the Internet. It is web browser agnostic. What works for big screens, works for small screens.

The Iterative Development teams use the Iterative Website Development Stack technologies

- The core technologies of Iterative WebsiteDevelopment are Git, the GitHub central project repository controlled by the project gatekeeper,  using Local Website Repository, the content delivery network, like Cloudflare, to deploying private [Preview](preview.md) Internet websites, production websites, and .

The core technologies of Iterative Development are Git, GitHub, and the Central Website Repository controlled by the project gatekeeper, and a Content Delivery Network (CDN), like Cloudflare, deploying Private Preview Internet websites, production websites, and individual team members Private Preview websites.


## Developers 

- Local Repository   
	Each team developer has their own Local Website Repository that can be updated from the Central Website Repository. Team members cannot update the Central Web Repository directly. They submit their changes. The approved changes by the project gatekeeper are added to the Central Website Repository. Team members can then update their Local Website Repository.

- VScode   
	Developers use [VSCode](vscode.md) as their Web Development Stack Command and Control center. They use it to edit code using their Local Website Repository, commit changes to the Central Website Repository, refresh their Local Website Repository, and deploy Private Preview Internet websites for themselves and stake holders to view and give feedback
	
- MkDocs Material  
	Is a Static Site Generator that uses the Local Website Repository to create a [Preview](preview.md) website for themselves and stakeholders  
	
	It is also used by the Content Delivery network(CDN) do build and deploy the production website from the Central Repository

-  GitHub

	GitHub is a Distributed Version Control Systems enabling multiple teams to work separately on the same project without having an impact on the work of others. GitHub manages an online web hosted Central Website Repository containing all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes, and helps answer the questions **who changed what, where, when, and why** for the lifetime of the project

	The Central Websit Repository is managed by a team member project gatekeeper with help from other team members


  - Stake Holders Private Preview Website
  	The same "MkDocs Static Site Generator" tools are used to create the "Production Website" by the "CDN - Deploy Website to Web"

Team members use the Website Development Stack to develop and deploy websites to the Internet. 

There would be confusion and possible defects created if Team members were to directly make changes to the central project repository.  

A solution to this problem is to have one central repository controlled by a team member gatekeeper. Each team member [forks](git-github#fork) a copy of central project repository to their GetHub account and makes a [clone](glossary#clone) of it on their workstation.

---


- Each developer makes changes to their repository [clone](glossary#clone). They cannot directly make changes to the central repository.

	- Team members commit changes to their local repository clone

	- They may deploy their local repository to a private [Preview](preview.md) Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback. 

- The process is managed using [GitHub for Teams](https://github.com/team). When stakeholders determine developers changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, a GitHub [Pull Request](git-github#pull-request) is made by developers to the central project repository. 

	- Project team members and the gatekeeper are notified by GitHub of the [Pull Request](git-github#pull-request) request. They may examine, comment on, suggest possible changes, and test the code. 

	- When the team agrees on committed developers changes, they are committed to the central project repository by the gatekeeper. This process is repeated for all developer committed changes. 

	- Iterations of the central project repository may be deployed by the gatekeeper to a private [Preview](preview.md)  for stakeholders viewing. 

- The next step is each developer [Pulls](git-github#pull) the central repository changes and commits them to their local repository copy of the central project. This process keeps team members up to date on changes.

- The central project repository may be deployed to the public Internet by the gatekeeper after stakeholders agree there have been sufficient development and testing iterations.

	The slightest configuration, programming or security defect issues during the project will require Remediating and increasing overall lifetime costs
